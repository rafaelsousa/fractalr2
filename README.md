# FractalR 2.0

This project is a port of my master thesis for a simple exploratory environment that creates fractals in a simple and intuitive way.

In 2010, we coded this project using JavaFX Script. Few years later, JavaFX 2.0 came and I decided to translate to this new Runtime.

It is a working progress so for now, just the layout will work. The logic will be ported later. 

## Dependencies

 This project was compiled with Java 11. So, installing any implementation should work.
 
 You doesn't need to have the JavaFX runtime installed, as it will download from a maven repository.

## To run

    $ mvn clean package javafx:run
